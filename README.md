This project is very much a hack-in-progress.  Please feel free to help make it better!


##Installation

1. clone the repository to a folder.
2. "npm install" to get the node bits.
3. edit the config.js with your settings.  (To get a github api key, go to your github account settings > applications)
4. node serverex.js

Node is only used to handle the github authentication.  All other queries are handled with clientside javascript.



##Details

###Planner

Drag and drop stories/issues into milestones.

Create new stories with default label and estimate

* Estimates are labels with the syntax "~ 1".  The character after the tilde can be used as a 'sort order', "~1 Small".

###Tasks

Create tasks attached to issues and drag and drop them through statuses.

* Tasks are made from github issue comments using the syntax [TASK STATUS @ASSIGNEE]. 

* The two github statuses of open and closed are always the first and last, respectively.  
* Custom statuses can be defined with the syntax "#1 InProgress" or "# InProgress" and will appear in order between the open and closed statuses.
* Currently all statuses must be one word (No spaces) for the TASK parsing to work correctly.
